# Mini Utilities
In this folder I keep small tools I frequently use for little tasks. 
Don't wonder, most of them are very simple.

For some of these tools, there are two versions, one with the "qad_" prefix, one without, e.g.:
- image_converter.py
- qad_image_converter.py
The "qad_" prefix stands for **q**uick **a**nd **d**irty - which usually are with minimized dependencies, but als require you to open the programm in an interpreter and adapt some things. However for single time use these should be easiest to quickly use with minimal troubles and issues.

## image_converter.py
Is an image converter. I created it mainly to convert .webp into .png images.
I frequently find myself having to change image formats - there are plenty of good free online tools, 
however I dislike having to rely on them in terms of data protection, especially for pictures of documents, internal information, or simply family pictures. Additionally whenever I am travelling I like to be able to convert my images without the need for an internet connection.
